Support
=======

We provide this extension "as is" to inspire other developers and maybe
to make some users happy with it's current functionality.

As this is not our core business, we cannot provide extensive support for
this extension and we cannot offer any development service. But we will
have a look on every issue and bug you provide. And of course we will
apply your patches if you sent it to us.
